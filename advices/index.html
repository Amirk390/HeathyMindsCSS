        <h4>I recently had my first MRI. I am 49 yrs old. Have been diagnosed with Complex partial sezures since I was 30 yrs old. I have had 2 Grand mal, both at night while sleeping. My seizures/auras started getting worse this past summer - difficult functioning with thoughts, motors skills, confusion....so another medication was added. I was taking 200 mg Tegretol twice daily, now we have added Topomax 50 mg twice daily twice daily which seems to have helped, however I have lost a lot of weight and feel nauseous 80 % of the time! So my neurologist has suggested that I have a MRI because my recent EEG showed slow brain waves?? Not sure what that means. When I was young, I had Encelphalitis, which the Dr says has caused a lesion which has caused seizures to develop. He said my this time, my EEG indicated slow brain waves from the opposite side than they have on other past EEG tests? So he ordered the MRI. I had the MRI 2 days ago...Most unpleasant experience! Are they supposed to be? I didn't think I could hold it together for the 25 minutes but I did! I've talked to others who have said they had headphones with music? I was not offered music? Would there be a reason for that? I was warned about the noises....but I almost couldn't take it...my anxiety was so high...I had taken 2 Lorazapam to calm be 1 hr before because I was afraid I might be clautrophic..but it was more the noises that bothered me! Just wanting to hear others MRI experiences!</h4><br>
